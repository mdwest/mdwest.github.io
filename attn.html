									<h1>Attention Startups: Equity Crowdfunding is Legal in Washington<br />
									â€” Really This Time</h1>
									<p>Startups in Washington can now get investments from non-accredited investors in exchange for securities.</p>

								<p>Of course, technically equity crowdfunding has been legal for years. Equity crowdfunding was passed federally in 2012. And, when it became clear the federal law was unworkable for most startups, states began passing their own versions. </p>
<p>Washington was the first state to pass intrastate Equity Crowdfunding legislation in 2014. But, after several years, only one company had applied to launch a crowdfunding campaign. </p>
<p>Intrastate Equity Crowdfunding wasn&rsquo;t viable largely because it relied on a pre-existing intrastate securities exemption (Rule 147) which prevented online advertising and limited businesses&rsquo; interstate activities (80% of the business&rsquo; assets, sales, and expenditures must remain in-state).</p>
<p>In October 2016, the SEC adopted new regulations modernizing rule 147 with rule 147a. The modern version allows intrastate securities to advertise online and doesn&rsquo;t unduly restrict the startup&rsquo;s ability to engage in interstate commerce. Instead the business only needs to meet one of four possible safe-harbors; including having a majority of its employees in-state, or holding 80% of its business&rsquo; assets in-state. </p>
<p>As of August 8th 2017, Washington adopted amendments to its intrastate equity crowdfunding law to take advantage of Rule 147a. Businesses are still required to file for pre-approval with the Washington Department of Financial Institutions before raising money. And most business will want to hire a lawyer to navigate this process. But, with these changes, Washington based start-ups can now raise up to one-million dollars from the millions of Washington residents who don&rsquo;t meet the income requirements of an accredited investor. This is a massive new funding opportunity for Washington based start-ups. But, after so many false starts, the good news seems to have gone without notice...? </p>
<p>Hopefully for no longer. If you are a entrepreneur who needs the capital to get your idea off the ground, or to scale your existing business, consider launching a Washington equity crowdfunding campaign. </p>
