									<h1>Kickstart your Company with Washington Intrastate Equity Crowdfunding</h1>
<p>This article provides a two-stage method for launching an Intrastate Equity Crowdfunding Campaign</p>

								<p>In my work with startups, funding is one of the biggest challenges faced by entrepreneurs. Not only are the laws surrounding investment complicated, but many entrepreneurs struggle to find investors. And, when negotiating with investors, limited funding options can result in unfavorable terms. Keep reading to learn how you can set the terms when raising funding for your startup.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s updated intrastate equity crowdfunding law offers an alternative to traditional investment and may be the best option for Washington based companies. Under state law, companies can raise up to $1,000,000 from Washington state residents; including non-accredited investors who make up the majority of Washington&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Each non-accredited investors can invest $2,000 or more depending on their income level. Simple, back of the napkin math shows a company could raise $1,000,000 from five-hundred $2,000 investors, from two-thousand $500 investors, or from any other mix of small and large investors.</p>
<p>Before launching a campaign, companies are required to file for approval with the Washington Department of Financial Institutions. This filing includes a $600 fee and substantial legal disclosures. To date, these costs have been a barrier to many companies. However, I recently submitted a letter to the Department of Financial Institutions requesting an advisory opinion on my proposed two-stage crowdfunding process.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 &ndash; Rewards Crowdfunding </strong></p>
<p>Stage one of my proposed process utilizes tradition rewards-based crowdfunding to test the market and determine whether the company can attract enough interest to justify launching an equity crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Like a traditional rewards campaign, the listing will offer rewards for supporting the company. However, the amount raised is less important than the number of contributors because each contributor will be added to an email list that will be used to notify contributors if/when the company begins accepting equity crowdfunding investment.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this stage will require a marketing campaign. It's a common misconception that crowdfunding platforms have tons of visitors ready to contribute. But, one crowdfunding marketing professional told me that as many as 80% of campaign contributors come from direct marketing outside the crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>In the case of intrastate equity crowdfunding, this marketing will be even more critical because the company will need to target Washington State Residents. The long-term goal is converting these supporters to investors, and Washington Intrastate Equity Crowdfunding only allows investment from Washington State residents (note: federal equity crowdfunding is an option, but it is a more expensive option and outside the scope of this article). Accordingly, companies need to get creative, and consider hiring a marketing specialist.</p>
<p>As a starting point, check out <a href="https://learn.indiegogo.com/the-essential-guide-to-crowdfunding/">Indiegogo&rsquo;s</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/help/handbook">Kickstarter&rsquo;s</a> guides to launching a rewards based Crowdfunding Campaign. More importantly, before launching a campaign be sure to speak to an attorney specialized in Washington Intrastate Equity Crowdfunding. The specific language used in the campaign and legal disclosures are important to ensure legal compliance.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 &ndash; Equity Crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p>Some companies have an existing marketing list, or retail establishment that can help promote their campaign. If this is the case, I might advise skipping the reward crowdfunding stage and jumping right into another creative solution to promoting an Equity Crowdfunding Offering. But the importance of stage one is ensuring the company has a pool of potential investors and a plan to attract them to invest.</p>
<p>An essential part of attracting investment will be offering an attractive capital structure designed for the needs of the particular business. The simplest option is offering common stock. Common stock essentially makes investors proportionate partners in the company. Investors won&rsquo;t receive liquidation preferences or other rights commonly negotiated by accredited investors. But, they will receive voting rights. For a seed stage company, looking to raise a small amount of money, this is the easiest and cheapest option to launch a campaign.</p>
<p>More detailed capital structures offer unique benefits to companies at different stages of development. For example, an established company with the revenue to pay dividends might offer preferred stock with defined dividends and a rights to repurchase the stock at a fixed price in the future. This structure allows companies to raise the capital they need, offering higher returns than traditional bonds, but preserving founder&rsquo;s equity by allowing the stock to be repurchased.</p>
<p>Alternatively, higher risk startups without the revenue to support dividends could offer convertible preferred stock. This preferred stock might have limited voting rights, but could offer a conversion premium allowing the investor to turn 1 share of preferred stock into 1.2 shares of common stock down the line. Depending on the arrangement, these structures can make the proposed stock more marketable to investors, helping the company raise the funding they need.</p>
<p>These are complicated legal agreements and I always discuss clients goals before determine a structure. But, one benefit to equity crowdfunding is that the company sets the terms. Those terms need to be marketable. And there are restrictions on overly complicated agreements. But there are lots of options to structure a deal that works for a wide range of companies.</p>
