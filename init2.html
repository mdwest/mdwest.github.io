									<h1>Initial Coin Offerings: A Primer on Securities Law Part 2</h1>
							</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ico.jpeg" alt="" /><p>Photo in the Pubic Domain</p></div>
								<p>In my last post, I discussed investment contracts under the Howie Test, utility tokens under recent Wyoming legislation, and options for complying with existing securities laws. In this post, I will delve deeper into two additional tests impacting ICO&rsquo;s. First the Family Resemblance Test, which determines whether a note, or debt instrument, qualifies as a security. And second the Risk Capital Test, which is an additional test of investment contracts applied to offerings in Washington State and 15 other US jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>The Family Resemblance Test </strong></p>
<p>For simplicity sake, a &ldquo;note&rdquo; can be thought of as an IOU. Most are aware of common forms of notes that don&rsquo;t qualify as securities including mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. However, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 explicitly includes the term &ldquo;notes&rdquo; in its definition of securities. Following passage of the Securities Act, case law developed a list of common notes exempt from securities regulations including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes delivered in consumer financing;</li>
<li>Notes secured by a mortgage on a home;</li>
<li>Short-term notes secured by a lien on a small business or some of its assets;</li>
<li>Notes evidencing a &lsquo;character&rsquo; loan to a bank customer;</li>
<li>Short-term notes secured by an assignment of accounts receivable and;</li>
<li>Notes which simply formalize an open-account debt incurred in the ordinary course of business.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1990, in the case of <em>Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>the Supreme Court formalizing this list of exemptions. At issue in <em>Reves </em>were a series of unsecured promissory notes, sold by an interstatefarmer's co-op. The notes were advertised as backed by the assets of the Co-op. But in 1984, the Co-op went bankrupt while 1,600 individuals held 10 Million dollars of debt. In a series of appeals, courts disagreed on whether the notes qualified as securities until the Supreme Court determined the notes were securities and developed the Family Resemblance Test.</p>
<p>The Family Resemblance Test begins with the presumption that all notes are securities and uses a four-part test to determine if the note resembles established exemptions. Those four prongs include:</p>
<p>1. The motivation that prompts a reasonable buyer and seller to enter into the transaction in question;<br>
2. The plan of distribution of the instrument;<br>
3. The reasonable expectations of the investing public; and<br>
4. The existence of an alternative regulatory scheme reducing the risk of the instrument.</p>
<p>The application of this test is fact specific, but in simple terms, the test asks whether the instrument has the defining characteristics of exempt notes. One important lesson of this case is that simply structuring an offering as debt does not avoid securities regulations and any token offering should seek a legal opinion on this test before offering tokens to the general public.</p>
<p><strong>The Risk Capital Test </strong></p>
<p>Beyond Federal law, most token offerings will need to consider state regulations and the Risk Capital Test. The Risk Capital Test originated in California after the 1959 case of <em>Silver Hills Country Club v. Sobieski. </em>In this case, enterprising entrepreneurs attempted to raise funding to launch a Country Club by pre-selling memberships to the proposed establishment. In some ways, this mirrors modern Kickstarter campaigns.</p>
<blockquote>Note: Looking back to Part 1 of this post, you will notice this offering does not violate securities laws under the Howie Test since there is no expectation of profits on the part of individuals purchasing memberships. </blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, unlike Kickstarter, the offering did not include a minimum target sufficient to ensure the successful launch of the Club, and when the Club failed to launch, members were left without any benefit. The California Supreme Court stepped in and developed the Risk Capital Test which was subsequently formalized in Washington Statutes as an:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;<em>investment of money or other consideration in the risk capital of a venture with the expectation of some valuable benefit to the investor where the investor does not receive the right to exercise practical and actual control over the managerial decisions of the venture&rdquo; </em></blockquote>
<p>In other words, even if an individual does not have an expectation of profits from money they contribute to a venture, if that contribution places heir money at risk the State could find the transaction to be an illegal securities offering. Token offerings should carefully structure their tokens to avoid violating both the Howie Test and the Risk Capital Test or restrict the sale of their tokens to States that have not enacted any version of the Risk Capital Test.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions </strong></p>
<p>This post has expanded on a few laws impacting ICO&rsquo;s highlighting additional challenges to offering a legally compliant token offering without registering as a securities offering. As a primer, it does not contain an in-depth discussion of the fact-specific application of these tests nor consider other laws which might impact particular offerings. If you have a concept for a unique token offering, be sure to discuss the idea with counsel early in the design process. This will allow your counsel to help direct your design efforts towards a legally compliant offering and inform you of any risks inherent to your particular offering.</p>
