									<h1>Regulation A+ and REITâ€™s: An Opportunity to Scale Real Estate Businesses</h1>
							</header>

								<p><strong>A Few Definitions </strong></p>
<p>To begin, Regulation A+ (Reg A+) is a securities law designed to allow mid-sized companies to raise investment from the general public. It allows issuers to raise up to $50 Million from both accredited and non-accredited investors, without submitting to cost-prohibitive state-by-state review under &ldquo;Blue Sky Laws.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>Blue Sky laws refer to State securities laws offering additional protections to investors. The term is said to have originated when a Justice declared his desire to protect investors from speculative ventures that had "as much value as a patch of blue sky." The term was first used by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Hall v. Geiger-Jones Co.</i>, 242 U.S. 539 (1917). But the origin is unclear as this use was attributed to an earlier unnamed source.</blockquote>
<p>REIT&rsquo;s, or Real Estate Investment Trusts, are companies that own and (generally) operate a portfolio of income producing properties. If the company meets the tax requirements of a REIT, including maintaining at least 100 shareholders and distributing dividends of at least 90% of the REIT&rsquo;s taxable income, then the company can avoid paying income tax. The shareholders are still obligated to pay taxes on their dividends, but especially considering recent tax cuts, this is a very favorable tax situation.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity </strong></p>
<p>Together Reg A+ and REIT &rsquo;s allow companies to raise millions of dollars from the general public for the purpose of investing in real estate. If the sponsoring or parent company is already in the business of managing or developing real estate, this is an opportunity to dramatically scale the number of properties in their portfolio.</p>
<p>Several companies including GroundFloor, Fundrise, and RealtyMogul recognized this opportunity. And to date, REIT&rsquo;s have raised hundreds of millions of dollars under Regulation A+. Fundrise alone has raised over $100 million, selling out two national REIT&rsquo;s (Growth eREIT and Income eREIT), offering additional goal specific REIT&rsquo;s, and raising millions in newer regional REIT&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>These early adopters have developed several structures for raising investment using Reg A+. The most successful has been the model pioneered by Fundrise. Its subsidiary structure both shields the sponsoring parent company from significant financial disclosures and gives the company flexibility to act quickly and execute on better real estate deals.</p>
<p><strong>The Local Angle </strong></p>
<p>I am particularly interested in tailoring the Fundrise structure to regional companies and investors. Real Estate is inherently local and area companies are better suited to navigate the local real estate market as well as manage the properties efficiently. Moreover, limiting the offering to a local region could minimize legal fees, broker fees, and ongoing reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Similarly, local investors intuitively understand the value proposition of real estate investments in their region (they pay the rent and experience the challenge of pulling together a down payment). With so many millennials deferring home ownership, there is increased demand for rental properties and a large pool of young professionals with capital to invest. A well-designed marketing plan could capitalize on these trends and raise significant funding to scale your company's portfolio.</p>
