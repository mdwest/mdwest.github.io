									<h1>Build your Startup&rsquo;s Website for the Cost of a Custom Domain</h1>
<p>Building a static website doesn&rsquo;t require coding skills or monthly fees.</p>
								</header>
								
<div class="image main"><img src="images/web.jpeg" alt="" /><p>Photo in the Pubic Domain</p></div>

<p>The website you are reading was built, and is being hosted for free, aside from the cost of securing a custom domain. I&rsquo;m not a developer and all you need is a basic understanding of HTML5 to build your own website. You can teach yourself as you go, but a tutorial such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gTw2EDkaDQ">this</a> is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Before you start coding, I advise downloading a text editor such as <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.4.html">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> and a template. Github offers some templates, but I found mine at <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5up</a>. Most templates have a demo version hosted, so click through a few and find the website structure and design that fits your brand and planned content.</p>
<p>Once you find the template you plan to use, download the file. It should have several folders, but all you need to work with are the loose HTML files, and any images you add.</p>
<p>To begin building your website open the index.html file in your preferred browser and your Notepad++ editor. Cross reference the two pages to find where the text on the web is written in the code. You can build your website by just changing that content. But, as you play with it, you will likely begin to learn the overarching structure and use the bits of code you need.</p>
<p>I advise beginning your editing in the header and footer sections because these will be identical across all your pages. And, it will save you time to have your navigation between pages figured out from the start. Once you have this done, your index.html file is now the template for every other page you create. You just need to changing the body section to display your substantive content on each page. Copy this file and make new versions renamed to match each page you will create.</p>
<p>With these files set up, you can begin creating your content. 
An easy way to develop your content without coding is to create it in a word document then convert it to a clean HTML5 version with an editor such as <a href="https://html-online.com/editor/">this</a>. As you are creating your webpage, save your work and refresh your browser. This will show you a real time version of your website as you create it. You&rsquo;ll learn the tags as you go, but one important note is that if you want to add an image, you need to put a copy of the image in the image folder and create a link to it in your html document. This sounds more complicated than it is and fortunately your template will have image placeholders in it, so just change the name of the placeholder image to the name of the file you added to the image folder and it should appear (take care to note the correct file type).</p>
<p>Once you have finished your pages, you are ready to put them online by creating your own free Github page. Github has <a href="https://pages.github.com">a reasonable guide</a> on the subject. But, it does use a few console commands. To avoid those, you can open a new repository using Github's website instead of the console. Just be sure to name the repository yourusername.github.io (where yourusername is your github account user name). If you have your Github desktop download, this should create a new folder within the Github folder named after the repository (The Github folder is in Documents if you did the standard install). Copy all the files from your template (i.e. all subfolders and html files) into this folder and use your Github desktop app to push it online (you can see the files online in your repository). If you make any edits in the future, you can just save the changes, then push the new version up to Github.</p>
<p>If you have any problems, refer to the Gihub pages guide, but if you follow the instructions, your website will now be online at yourusername.github.io.</p>
<p>If you are happy with that address, you can stop here. But, for a professional website, I advise setting up a custom domain and adding security to your website.</p>
<p>To add a custom domain to your website, you need to secure one at any reputable domain registrar. Then follow this Github <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">guide</a> to set up your DNS records to point to Github. The one piece not made clear in the guide is that you need to delete all "A" DNS records, then add two new "A" records pointing to the following IP addresses: 192.30.252.153, 192.30.252.154. However, even if the guide isn&rsquo;t perfect, Google is your friend and if you are having trouble there is probably a forum post with another user struggling through 
the same problem (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/">Troubleshooting)</a>. Either way, expect to be patient, updating the domain records will take a few hours to propagate across the internet.</p>
<p>If you stop here, your website will work from your custom domain, but your visitors may be warned that your site is unsecured. So I advise pressing on and adding security to your website using Cloudflare. Their guide is pretty strait forward, so I won&rsquo;t duplicate it. But here is the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/">link</a>.</p>
<p>One word of caution as you move forward with building your website. Be careful with any images you use and make sure you don&rsquo;t violate someone&rsquo;s copyright. It sounds like a bad horror movie, but there are digital spiders trolling the internet looking for copyright violators. 
In the future, I may write a more detailed post on the subject. But for quick advice, try to use your own pictures or images explicitly in the public domain. An image is not in the pubic domain just because it was a Google image result. 
<a href="https://www.pexels.com/public-domain-images/">This</a> is a good source for high quality public domain images.</p>
<p>I hope this guide helps you stake claim to your corner of the internet and share your startup&rsquo;s message!</p>
