									<h1>Contingency Fees: An Option for Bootstrapping an Equity Crowdfunding Campaign</h1>
								</header>

<p>If you read my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.westlinelaw.com/attn">earlier post</a> on equity crowdfunding, you are aware that Washington has a new law allowing businesses to raise up to one-million dollars from Washington residents. This means you can raise investment from friends, family, customers, colleges, and any other Washington State resident.</p>
<p>However, equity crowdfunding is a substantial undertaking; involving a marketing campaign, thousands of dollars in legal work and ongoing reporting requirements. This article looks at the contingency fee arrangement as an option to reduce up-front costs and minimize the risk of an equity crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Contingency fees have a bad reputation. Most people think of ambulance chasing lawyers taking one-third of their client&rsquo;s settlement. This is abusive and isn&rsquo;t our model for equity crowdfunding. Instead, we use contingency fees to defer payment of our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.westlinelaw.com/fees">advertised flat-fees</a>. We don&rsquo;t need to charge a premium for this deferral because we mitigate our risk by reviewing prospective clients' marketing plan and only accepting clients we believe will succeed.</p>
<p>Together, our deferred contingency fees arrangement has three key benefits.</p>
<p>1) The arrangement reduces the up-front cost of launching an equity crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>2) The arrangement reduces the risk of launching a campaign, ensuring you aren&rsquo;t stuck with thousands of dollars in legal fees if your campaign fails.</p>
<p>3) The arrangement aligns our interests. We only get paid if you succeed. And we hope to continue providing legal services as you scale your business.</p>
<p>Best of all, if you have an incorporated business, with the capacity to produce GAAP compliant financial, and the capacity to manage a marketing campaign, you could file to launch your campaign for as little as $1,000 in up-front costs. If this is beyond your means, but you have a great idea, you may consider filing for an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/seattle">Awesome Foundation Grant</a> to help cover up-front costs.</p>
