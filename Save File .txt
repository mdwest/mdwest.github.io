<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p> We believe in offering competitive and transparent rates without compromising quality. You can complete piece work through a budget legal service that matches you with a lawyer of your choice. 
But they may not provide the legal advice you need. They will file a trademark for you, but they may not advise you about potential trademark conflicts. 
They will organize a company for you, but they may fail to include important corporate policy advice regarding intellectual property, employment discrimination, 
independent contractor definitions and other pitfalls that can lead to legal trouble down the line. We combine competitive, transparent fees with the premium service
 you need to succeed and don't cut legal corners just because you may be unaware of the corner.</p>
