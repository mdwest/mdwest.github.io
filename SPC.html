									<h1>The Social Purpose Corporation</h1>
<p>A great option for integrating a social mission into your startup</p>
								</header>

<p>Businesses integrated social purposes into their corporate mission long before the Benefit Corporation (B-corp) or the Social Purpose Corporation (SPC) existed. Founders integrated these social purposes because they are passionate about an issue, because they want a business that does more than make money and because the social mission can help to differentiate/market their company.</p>
<p>A traditional corporate structure can accommodate social missions; however modern corporate law (influenced by the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Law and Economics scholarship) obligates corporations to pursue profit maximization. The extent of this fiduciary duty is an important area of law, often tested during mergers and acquisitions (especially if hostile).</p>
<p>The Benefit Corporation was developed as one solution to this modern trend, allowing founders to integrate a social mission into the DNA of their corporation. However, some legal scholars and institutional investors argue that the parallel duty of profit maximization and a social mission create an inevitable conflict, risking litigation on every corporate decision. Accordingly, when Washington considered B-corporation legislation, they amended the proposal, creating the Social Purpose Corporation. The key difference with the new SPC was permissive language around the social mission, removing the risk of conflicts and reducing the reporting requirements. These amendments make it one of the best options for integrating a social mission if you plan to headquarters your business in Washington.</p>
<p>That said, before deciding on a corporate structure, be sure to discuss your business model, goals and plans for raising investment with your attorney. These details might impact where you choose to incorporate or make alternative corporate structures desirable. But, if you are a Washington entrepreneur interested in creating a social venture that does more than make a profit, Washington's Social Purpose Corporation is worth considering.</p></section>
