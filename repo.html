					<h4><font size="+2">Car dealerships scam customers every day.</font> They walk on your rights knowing you probably won't fight and won't find someone to fight for you. I know this because a friend 
					recently came to me complaining about how they were treated by a car dealership. After winning their case and learning how common these scams are I decided to stand up for those most harmed, 
					<strong>people who have their cars repossessed</strong>. If you are reading this article, there is a good chance, you or someone you know is the victim of one of the following scams.</h4>

					<h4>If you have bought a car in the last four years, you have rights under Washington&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Laws. <strong>If one of the following three scams occurred
					I may be able to get you a full refund on your vehicle</strong></h4>
					<h3 align="center"><strong>Three Common Scams</strong></h3>
					<h4><strong>1) False or Misleading Contract</strong></h4>
					<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did your car dealer agree to reduce the down-payment without changing the contract?</h4>
					<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did your car dealer agree to accept part of the down-payment when you get your next paycheck?</h4>
					<h4>Car dealerships that employ high-pressure sales tactics often make deals on the fly without writing them into the contract. If we can prove you paid your down-payment in installments that weren&rsquo;t specified in your contract we can get you a full refund.</h4>
					<h4><strong>2) Failure to Disclose Loan Terms</strong></h4>
					<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did your car dealer fail to disclose the interest rate, number of payments, amount financed or details about the creditor?</h4>
					<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did your car dealer fail to disclose that you would still owe money on a trade-in vehicle?</h4>
					<h4>Under the Truth in Lending Act Dealers are required to make full and correct disclosures about car financing. Often they rush you through these documents, so it is important we review copies of anything you signed. But if they made any mistakes, or failed to make full disclosures we may be able to get you a full refund.</h4>
					<h4><strong>3) Yo-Yo Sales (a.k.a. Bushing Scam or Spot-Delivery)</strong></h4>
					<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did your car dealer tell you financing fell through and require you to return to the dealership?</h4>
					<h4>When buying a car most people don&rsquo;t realize the contract is contingent on the dealership securing financing. Dealers often make deals they don&rsquo;t intend to honor and require the customer to return to the dealership to renegotiate. This tactic is often used to scam customers and if the dealership didn&rsquo;t follow the exact letter of the law you may have a right to a full refund.</h4>
